# :rocket:  IBM_Data_Science_Capstone_Project
This is the Last course of the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) .In this Course we will be Completing the [IBM Data Science Capstone Project](https://www.coursera.org/learn/applied-data-science-capstone?specialization=ibm-data-science).At the end of this Project we will receive our Certificate and the course will come to an end.
## ðŸ“„ Project Background
SpaceX is the most successful company of the commercial space age, making space travel affordable. The company advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. Based on public information and machine learning models, we are going to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.
